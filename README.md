# Multinomial-Approximations-for-compartmental-models
Explanation on how to use the Multinomial Approximations for compartmental models proposed in "Inference in Stochastic Epidemic Models via Multinomial Approximations" by N. Whiteley and L. Rimella. The repository contains two tutorials:
1- application to the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1995 (in Python);
2- application to the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan (in R).
